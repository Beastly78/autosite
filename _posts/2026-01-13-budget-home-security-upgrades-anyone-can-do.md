**Security On A Shoestring: Budget Home Security Upgrades Anyone Can Do**
=====================================================================================

As the world becomes increasingly connected, home security has become a top concern for homeowners everywhere. With the rise of smart home technology, it's easy to get caught up in the hype of expensive security systems and cameras. But what if you're on a tight budget? Don't worry, we've got you covered. In this article, we'll explore budget-friendly home security upgrades that anyone can do.

**Section 1: Assessing Your Risks**
------------------------------------

Before diving into security upgrades, it's essential to assess your risks. A good starting point is to identify potential entry points into your home. Are you a target for break-ins in your neighborhood? Are there any security cameras or lights in your area? Take note of these factors and focus on upgrading your security in those areas first.

**Section 2: Basic Upgrades for Maximum Impact**
---------------------------------------------

While high-tech security systems can be expensive, there are several basic upgrades that can make a significant difference in your home's security. Here are a few options:

### 1. **Rekeying Your Locks**

Rekeying your locks can be a cheap and effective way to upgrade your home's security. By changing the pins inside your locks, you can give yourself a new set of keys and prevent previous residents from gaining entry. This upgrade costs anywhere from $20 to $100, depending on the type of lock and the locksmith's fee.

### 2. **Adding Outdoor Lighting**

Outdoor lighting is one of the most effective deterrents against break-ins. Motion-sensitive lights can be installed around your home's perimeter to detect movement and alert you to potential intruders. Prices start at around $50 for a single light, and you can install multiple lights around your home.

### 3. **Installing Window and Door Sensors**

Window and door sensors are a great way to monitor your home's entry points. These sensors trigger an alert when a door or window is opened or closed, giving you peace of mind and a higher level of security. Prices range from $20 to $50 per sensor, depending on the type and brand.
